The next chapter of my life has started.  A chapter without cell phones.  A chapter without student loan debt.  A chapter of 
freedom.  A chapter of hope.  A chapter free from addiction and anger.  A chapter that is new.  

I am less full of rage now.  And I can feel my mind becoming free of my addiction.  In the coming weeks and months I will be 
as I was.  Soon, I will know that I am free.  You see, the cell phone made my addiction functional in a way it never code be
before.  Without it, I will be forced to live my life.  I will be forced to be real.  I realize now that my cell phone added
to my addiction to screens, rather than detracting from it.  It's like giving a heroine addict a stead stream so he does not
miss his addiction.  He never goes through withdrawal, so clearly he must be cured, when in fact he is more of an addict than
before.  He is actual the worst off he could possibly be.  

And his mind is slowly being eaten away.  His thoughts clouded.  I must do what I can to ease these withdrawal period.  
My mind will be clear soon.  I will be clear soon.  But first, I must allow myself to feel.  I will have more energy at first.
And so I will feel renewed.  But in time, I will again feel the strain of life.  I will go through withdrawal as I did before.
And eventually, I will feel weaker.  I must be careful about how I ease myself off of the this addiction.

I understand now.  The smart phone is a dangerous lie.  I must never allow myself to own one again, whatever the advantage,
it weakens me.
